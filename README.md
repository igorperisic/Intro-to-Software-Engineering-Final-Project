# Intro-to-Software-Engineering-Final-Project
Created in Java in Eclipse using AWT and Swing. Main functionalities: load a roster, Add Attendance, Save and Plot Data.

• Collaborated in a three man team.
• Load a Roster functionality asks the user for a File path, the
file is a CSV file; it reads the file, loads the data into a data
structure and displays the data using JTable.
• Add Attendance functionality is similar to Load a Roster,
however it also asks the user to pick a date.
• Save functionality saves all data, exactly what is displayed on
the JTable, in a CSV file.
• Plot data functionality creates a chart using the attendance
data per student in the form of a scatter plot.
